# Flutter Meal App

The Flutter Meal App is a mobile application developed using the Flutter framework. It allows users to explore a variety of meals from different categories and provides details such as ingredients, difficulty level, affordability, convenience, and cooking time for each meal. Additionally, users can add their favorite meals to a favorites list and apply filters to display meals with specific attributes.

## Features
